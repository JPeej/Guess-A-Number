<h1 align="center">Guess The Number</h1>

I was tasked to create a SGuess The Number game in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day twelve of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Global and local scope

<h2>What I learned</h2>
I learned how to properly use global and local scope. I will admit that I butchered these concepts within my last project, Blackjack. I learned to try to limit global variables, how to properly manipulate them via functions, and to not name local and global variables the same. It all makes sense after this lesson. I think the teacher was hoping we made mistakes and dealt with the bugs in the last project.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
None! Today felt really good.
